I added the answers to the questions inside the ReadMe.md as requested.
Worked on my code in CodePen, then transferred my current code over to Visual Code.
Still trying to make the header look correct.
Added hero-image.

Re-worked header and am happy with the header > logo > nav > nav links a.
Re-worked hero-image and am happy with the placement of it.
Added about.html page
Connected the about.html page to my index.html and it opens in a new tab
Added colors to all Boxes.
Added responsive breakpoints with media queries at 800px and 500px.
Still need to to: make the boxes look like the design templates for 800px and 500px sizes.
