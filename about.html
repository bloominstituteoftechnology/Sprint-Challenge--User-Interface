    I chose Lambda school to further my education in tech because I wanted to learn the ins and outs of web development. THATâ€™S IT! I did not want to waste my time, or money on things like taking extra math classes, doing reading/english assignments, or trying to remember what year America got its independence. I wanted to learn further more about my passion, and stick to that. I want to put all my time and resources into something that I know will help and benefit me. Into something I don't feel like was a waste of my time in 5 years. 
<br>Sorry! I RAN OUT OF TIME!<br>
