1. Semantic tags are a special type of tag used in html. They are used for two reasons.
    a. make it easier for other developers to work on code
    b. used for SEO.

The tags provide a name that represents the part of the page
they are in. Like 'header' and 'section'. They basically provide a list of importance to the content that is on the page. They are
invisible to the user. 

2. Display block creates a block that spreads out horizontally
on the page. By default it wants to take 100% of the page width or
the container that it is in. You get one child per line. In order to be able to display multiple children or items we have to use inline-block. This allows the children to be displayed side by side. You are only limited by the width of the children and the width of the parent container. 

3. margin, padding, border, content

4. cross axis

5. git commit -m "add message here".
