1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML means we're organizing our webpage in a way that provides not only organizational benefits but also search engine optimization benefits. An example of this is when you're searching on Google for a company's contact information then having that contact information display prominently at the top of your search results. In the case of the contact information displaying at the top of your search results, it's most likely related to the company's website using semantic tags for that information on their website, which allows Google (and other search engines) to index that information for easier reference.

2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
My understanding is that "display: block;" takes up the full width of the view whereas "display: inline;" only takes up the space that it needs. 

In more detail "display: block;" does not mean that the element displayed on the screen takes up the whole width of the view, it means once you've set an element to conform to "display: block;"  that no other elements can be added to the left or right of it since we're saying it should be on its own line. Alternatively when we set an element to conform to "display: inline;" the element does allow other elements to be displayed to the left or right of it, and it only takes up the space it needs for the content.
