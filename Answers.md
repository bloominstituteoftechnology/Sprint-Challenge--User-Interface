If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

<!-- Semantic HTML deals with tags that are standard for most browsers. While you could write your own HTML tags, like <answer></answer>, these will not be cross-browser compatible. All Browswers need to be able to recognize code that has been built-in. This is where semantic HTML shines. This type of coding includes tags that are compatible for most, if not all, browsers. These tags can describe parts of a page, <header></header>, describe the kind of element <a></a>, or be a generic container to place elements <div></div>, useful for page alignment purposes.   -->

Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

<!-- The differences between displays are these: 1. Display: Block will have a width that reaches across the page. The items inside could be a single letter, but the container it is held inside will have a width crossing the entire page. If there are two elements or two different groups of elements with Display: Block, the next group of items/items, will always be on the next line. Display-Block allows a width to be set. By default the container reaches the total browser page width. However, if a width is placed in css code, it will change accordingly. Block:Inline is different. Inline will only take the width of the element inside. If there is only a single letter, the container will be the width of the letter. If there are multiple inline elements, all elements will be on the same line. Width cannot be placed on an in-line element. Each semantic tag element has a default display. The paragraph tage <p> is by default a block element. On the other hand a span, is an inline element. These elements can be changed to fit a website design. There is a third type of display that combines display: block and display: inline. This is called Display: inline-block. If you want an element to have a width, and also be placed on the same line as another element, you need to use display: inline-block. This allows the element to act like both a block element with a width, and like an in-line element, which allows for an element to stay on the same line. -->
