Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.
A block element always starts on a new line, and fills up the horizontal space left and right on the web page. You can add margins and padding on all four sides of any block element — top, right, left, and bottom.block elements like <div>and <p>.Inline elements don’t start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of inline elements are <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags.
