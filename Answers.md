1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
    Semantic HTML is HTML that uses tag names that are more specific about what is contained within them. For example, when using a <div> tag, there is no way of knowing what is contained in that tag based on the tag itself. Whereas using a semantic tag, such as <nav>, <header>, <section>, or <footer>, gives a little bit more information about what is contained inside of the tag.  


2. Describe some differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
    An element with display: block; will take up the entire width of its container. An element that has display: inline; will only take up as much horizontal space as it's content needs. This allows other elements to be on the same line.
