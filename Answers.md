1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

### Semantic HTML
#### It provides precise meaning to your content. In other words, we describe tags with meaning.
#### For example:

#### <header>
#### <footer>
#### <main>
#### <section>

##### Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics

#### To better understand semantics, it makes your websites readable and easily interpreted by the screen-readers and search-engines. As a fellow developer, it helps the next developers to read and understand the code and easier to maintain as it is organized. 


2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

### Differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```

### Inline-block
#### It respects height and aligns next to each other. It allows you to cut out the page into multiple parts and have block level elements inside of them without taking up the entire page.

#### Ex.: https://codepen.io/iteldomingo/pen/pqooMJ?editors=1100 

### Block element
#### Takes up the entire length of the page.
#### Ex.: https://codepen.io/iteldomingo/pen/dwyPPm


3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

#### Content, Margin, Border, Padding


4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

#### It controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.


5. What is the git command to commit staged changes as well as write a message? 

#### Git is crucial as developers use it to store projects and keep track of real-time changes to their files, it makes a collaborative work between teams. Let's say a group of developers uploads code to git and other developers can access and edit it. With that said, it is to avoid confusion with having multiple people work on the same file at the same time.
