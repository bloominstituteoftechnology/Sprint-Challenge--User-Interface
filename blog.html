                <h1>The exciting world of web development</h1>
                <p>As a web developer, you get to be the person who builds everything that the world sees and interacts with on the internet. Web developers use a variety of programming languages and frameworks to help companies build solutions to real-world problems.</p>
                <p>No matter what you are passionate about or interested in, chances are a company or organization in that field is looking to hire web developers. And as a developer, you get to be the person that translates your passion into a functional website or web application to share with the world.</p>
                <p>You are going to need persistence, curiosity, determination, and grit to be successful, and at Lambda, you'll learn how to connect your learning to real projects so you can start making an impact on your first day in your new career.</p>

                    <h2>What will be fun</h2>
                    <p>Learning web development allows you to build your ideas with instant gratification along the way. Every time you refresh your browser you get to see something you envisioned manifest itself on your screen in real-time.  It makes coding both exciting and rewarding.</p>

                    <h2>What will be hard</h2>
                    <p>Learning to code is like learning a new language - it’s going to take a lot of practice before you are fluent. If you are new to programming, you may find that it’s a totally different way of thinking about and approaching problems. It may take time to adjust, but you'll get there!</p>
